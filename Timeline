### Steps and Timeline
* Project Proposal
  * Finished. Nov 19 2019
* Data Collection and Preprocessing
  * Some data resources are found, but still need the pure city map image dataset and an appropriate label dataset for cities.
  * Preprocess data that will be used by SVM, MLP and CNN directly including work of labeling, Feature scaling and special optimization base on selecting model.
  * Deadline: Nov 21 2019.
* Building Kernel Soft SVM model and MLP Model
  * Find an appropriate kernel and high value features for the SVM model and adjust the hyperparameters with experiment.
  * Find an appropriate layers and layer size for the MLP model and adjust it with experiment.
  * Evaluate a best model for numeric and category value in this project.
  * Deadline: Nov 22 2019
* Building CNN Model
  * Select an appropriate existing CNN model to train and test the city or global map dataset(small part).
  * Adjusting its inside layers and find the best performance model.
  * Deadline: Nov 25 2019
  
* Combining the SVM(or MLP) model and the CNN model to generate the new model for better city evaluation accuracy.
  * Test it with the test set spilt at the data preprocessing steps and print the score.
  * Deadline: Nov 26 2019
* (Optional) Building the RNN(or Markov) Model to Predict the Future Trend of City
* (Optional) Building the GAN Model
  * Using the geography image as X and city image as Z and taking evaluation value as parameter to train and test the model.
  * Using an empty geography image to build a city image.
  * Combining the future evaluation of a city, previous city image and existing geography image to build the future city image.
* (Optional) Finding the livable area for human
  * Reconstruct the city evaluation model with only nature feature such as geography and climate as features.
  * Evaluate the area around the world roughly and selecting the large areas with high value.
  * Spilt the large areas and evaluating the small areas again(may reconstruct the model again) and find the most livable places for human.
* Bias, Variance and Noise Analyzation
  * Using bagging or other methods to improve the performance.
  * Adding some specific layers to the GAN to improve the image performance.
  * Something else, unknown yet.
  * Deadline: Dec 1 2019
* Final Project Paper Writing
  * Deadline: Dec 5 2019
* Checking
  * Timeline may delay when facing hard problem.
